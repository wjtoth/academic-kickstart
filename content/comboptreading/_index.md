The purpose of our reading group is for students to learn new things, gain practice presenting research to their peers, and possibly pick up a research question or two in the process.

Each semester we have a new topic of combinatorial optimization.

**When:** Fridays, 1:00pm - 2:30pm
**Where:** MC 5479
