*Group A: Coloring in minor closed classes* (these papers require some expertize in graph minors theory)

1. 'Additive non-approximability of chromatic number in proper minor-closed classes' by Dvorak and Kawarabayashi.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03888.pdf 

2. An additive t+3 approximation of the chromatic number for minor-closed classes that avoid a fixed t-apex graph as a minor. See Theorem 5 from the work of Dvorak and Kawarabayashi mentioned above. 

3. A 2-approximation for the chromatic number in minor closed classes. Based on the work of Demaine, Hajiaghayi, and Kawarabayashi in the paper titled 'Algorithmic Graph Minor Theory: Decomposition, Approximation, and Coloring'. 
http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Decomposition_FOCS2005/paper.pdf 

*Group B: Coloring in general graphs*

1. Hardness of coloring. See 'On the hardness of 4-coloring a 3-colorable graph' by Guruswami and Khanna, and 'On the hardness of approximating the chromatic number' by Khanna, Linial, and Safra.
https://doi.org/10.1137/S0895480100376794
https://doi.org/10.1007/s004930070013

2. 'Coloring 3-colorable graphs with o(n^1/5) colors' by Kawarabayashi and Thorup. 
First talk covers combinatorial techniques used in this paper.

3. Second talk (on the above paper) covers the semi-definite programming approaches.

*Group C: Other interesting results on coloring.*

1. 'NP-Hardness of Coloring 2-Colorable Hypergraph with Poly-Logarithmically Many Colors' by Amey Bhangale. 
http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9019/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2018-15.pdf

2. 'Linear Degree Extractors and the Inapproximability of Max Clique and Chromatic Number' by David Zuckerman.
http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v003a006/v003a006.pdf

3.'Rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for colorings below Vigoda’s 11/6 threshold' by Delcourt, Perarnau, and Postle.
