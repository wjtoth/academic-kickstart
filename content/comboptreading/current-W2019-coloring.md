This term our reading group studies approximations for the chromatic number of a graph. 
This topic was suggested by **Ben Moore**. Thank you Ben for contributing the topic and suggested list of papers!

Ben will also give our *first talk*, an overview of the area and the first result in Group A, on **January 18th.**

The suggested papers are available below. If you would like to present one of the unclaimed papers, or suggest a paper to present, please get in touch with one of the organizers.


__Group A: Coloring in minor closed classes__ *(these papers require some expertise in graph minors theory)*
