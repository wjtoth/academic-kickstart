This term our reading group studies approximations for the chromatic number of a graph. 
This topic was suggested by **Ben Moore**. Thank you Ben for contributing the topic and suggested list of papers!

Ben will also give our *first talk*, an overview of the area, on **January 18th.**

The suggested papers are available below. If you would like to present one of the unclaimed papers, or suggest a paper to present, please get in touch with one of the organizers.


__Group A: Coloring in minor closed classes__ *(these papers require some expertize in graph minors theory)*

1. _*To be claimed*_ 'Additive non-approximability of chromatic number in proper minor-closed classes' by Dvorak and Kawarabayashi.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03888.pdf 

2. _*To be claimed*_ An additive t+3 approximation of the chromatic number for minor-closed classes that avoid a fixed t-apex graph as a minor. See Theorem 5 from the work of Dvorak and Kawarabayashi mentioned above. 

3. _*To be claimed*_ A 2-approximation for the chromatic number in minor closed classes. Based on the work of Demaine, Hajiaghayi, and Kawarabayashi in the paper titled 'Algorithmic Graph Minor Theory: Decomposition, Approximation, and Coloring'. 
http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Decomposition_FOCS2005/paper.pdf 

__Group B: Coloring in general graphs__

1. _*To be claimed*_ Hardness of coloring. See 'On the hardness of 4-coloring a 3-colorable graph' by Guruswami and Khanna, and 'On the hardness of approximating the chromatic number' by Khanna, Linial, and Safra.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s004930070013

2. _*To be claimed*_ 'Coloring 3-colorable graphs with o(n^1/5) colors' by Kawarabayashi and Thorup. 
First talk covers combinatorial techniques used in this paper.

3. _*To be claimed*_ Second talk (on the above paper) covers the semi-definite programming approaches.

__Group C: Other interesting results on coloring.__

1. _*To be claimed*_ 'NP-Hardness of Coloring 2-Colorable Hypergraph with Poly-Logarithmically Many Colors' by Amey Bhangale. 
http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9019/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2018-15.pdf

2. _*To be claimed*_ 'Linear Degree Extractors and the Inapproximability of Max Clique and Chromatic Number' by David Zuckerman.
http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v003a006/v003a006.pdf

3. _*To be claimed*_ 'Rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for colorings below Vigoda’s 11/6 threshold' by Delcourt, Perarnau, and Postle.
